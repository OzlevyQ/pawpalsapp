## Overview

This guide establishes Git workflows for PawPals, a multi-component project consisting of:
- **Mobile App** (`PawPalsMobile/`): React Native with Expo
- **Backend API** (`backend/`): Node.js/Express with MongoDB
- **Legacy Frontend** (`frontend/`): Capacitor-based (maintenance mode)

Our workflow prioritizes stability, code quality, and efficient collaboration while supporting parallel development across multiple components.

## Repository Structure

## Branching Strategy

### GitFlow-Based Strategy with Component Awareness

We use a modified GitFlow strategy optimized for multi-component development:

```
main (production-ready code)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ develop (integration branch)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/mobile/<feature-name>
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/backend/<feature-name>
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/fullstack/<feature-name>
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hotfix/<fix-name>
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ release/<version>
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ experimental/<experiment-name>
```

### Branch Types and Naming Conventions

#### 1. Main Branches

**`main`** - Production-ready code
- Always deployable
- Protected branch requiring PR reviews
- Tagged for releases
- Direct pushes forbidden

**`develop`** - Integration branch
- Latest development changes
- Feature branches merge here first
- Continuous integration testing
- Source for release branches

#### 2. Feature Branches

**Component-Specific Features:**
```bash
feature/mobile/user-authentication
feature/mobile/dog-profile-management
feature/backend/push-notifications
feature/backend/garden-analytics
feature/fullstack/event-registration
```

**Cross-Component Features:**
```bash
feature/fullstack/real-time-chat
feature/fullstack/payment-integration
```

**Branch Creation:**
```bash
# Create feature branch from develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/mobile/dog-profile-management

# Push to remote and set upstream
git push -u origin feature/mobile/dog-profile-management
```

#### 3. Hotfix Branches

```bash
hotfix/critical-security-fix
hotfix/mobile-crash-fix
hotfix/api-memory-leak
```

**Hotfix Process:**
```bash
# Create from main for critical production fixes
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-security-fix

# After fix, merge to both main and develop
git checkout main
git merge hotfix/critical-security-fix
git tag -a v1.2.1 -m "Hotfix: Critical security vulnerability"
git push origin main --tags

git checkout develop
git merge hotfix/critical-security-fix
git push origin develop
```

#### 4. Release Branches

```bash
release/v1.3.0
release/v2.0.0-beta
```

**Release Process:**
```bash
# Create release branch from develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b release/v1.3.0

# Version bumps, final testing, documentation updates
# Merge to main when ready
git checkout main
git merge release/v1.3.0
git tag -a v1.3.0 -m "Release v1.3.0: New gamification features"
git push origin main --tags

# Merge back to develop
git checkout develop
git merge release/v1.3.0
git push origin develop
```

## Release Management

### Versioning Strategy

We use **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)** with component-specific considerations:

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH[-PRERELEASE]

Example: v2.1.3-beta.2
```

**Version Increment Rules:**
- **MAJOR**: Breaking API changes, major mobile app overhauls
- **MINOR**: New features, non-breaking API additions
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes, security patches, minor improvements

### Release Types

#### 1. Mobile App Releases

**App Store Releases:**
```bash
# Production release
v2.1.0 - App Store deployment
v2.1.0-ios - iOS-specific build
v2.1.0-android - Android-specific build

# Beta testing
v2.1.0-beta.1 - Internal testing
v2.1.0-rc.1 - Release candidate
```

**Expo Updates (OTA):**
```bash
# Over-the-air updates for non-native changes
ota-2.1.1 - Critical bug fix
ota-2.1.2 - Minor UI improvements
```

#### 2. Backend API Releases

```bash
# API versioning
api-v1.2.0 - Stable API release
